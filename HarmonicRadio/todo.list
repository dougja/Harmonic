Current Issues:

	- Fix Problem with newlines in XML.
	- Add methods to create personal playlists.
	- Add methods to load/save playlist to file.
	- ensure that recently played tracks work with this.
	- Rethink how the Compilations class tells the StreamPlayer to play.
	- Update meeting minutes.

Other stuff that needs to be considered:

	- Algorithms to match country of IP to radio stations.
	- What to do if player cannot receive station (access error: no data received) (timeout?)
