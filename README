This is the Harmonic Git Repository.

To use, do the following.

1,Set up public keys in personal preferences on github.
2,Ask Phil to add you to collaborators on the project.

3,Go to the folder you wish to have the Harmonic folder.
4,Use the command: git clone git@github.com:pClamp/Harmonic.git

If you've added a new file
5, git add 'file name here' (alternatively you can use a dot to add all)

This will create and download the current source code repository onto your computer.
Make your changes and commit:
6, git commit -a -m 'write the changes you made here'

Upload the changes to the git repository:
7, git push

===================================================================

When you next come to work on Harmonic stuff

8, git pull
This command will update the current version to the one in the repository (obviously you might not need to do this if you haven't pushed what you've already done.

At least this is the way that I understand it - not got my head around the version control part of it yet :)
EDIT:
Aha, this is excellent. The version control part is all in the repository :)
